	return EXIT_SUCCESS;
  // we didn't do anything function call or export function inside the corresponding dll file , but when we successfully load the dll , the DllMain was successfully executed!
  //if you like you can add some error handling , but here ,for simplicity purpose , we just call the LoadLibrary function , and nothing else 
  //When using the LoadLibrary function , we don't need to set the including header path . dynamic library linking file .a or .lib for linking .dll file to an .exe 
  //we don't need to specify the .dll file file , since loadlibrary almost will do everything for us

//When you have included the PCH files into your project root folder , still get error prompts that "can't find the "stdafx.h" 
// Try to reload your solution , close and reopen , sometimes this works for me

//Toggle the Show all files button on this table , you will find your source code sorted in Header / Sources folders form or shows all the file 
//directly including the project or solution settings files if this button is in on status .
